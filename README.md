# Time series forecasting with LSTM
This project attempts to forecast Temperature using an LSTM from the Jena Climate dataset which is a weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. The Jena Climate dataset is made up of 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. This dataset covers data from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2016.
